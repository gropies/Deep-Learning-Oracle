# Deep-Learning-Oracle

This is the repository for Team Orcale!
The project aims to transfer a photo to the style of a picture.
The innovation points lies in:
We made improvements on preserving the global and local structure. As the neural network focuses on the center of contents, ignoring further details. The style transfer can be a failure in preserving nuances. We would like to pretrain more structure in order to stabalize the transfer on photos that have complex details and on style whose strokes may be more inconsistent.
